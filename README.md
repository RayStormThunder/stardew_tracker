This is a tracker specifically designed for Stardew Valley archipelago but on one specific setting.
More work has been done to make other settings possible. Other people could add checks themselves via the jsons.

Currently the tracker is implemented and sever connection works. 

There are tons of bugs in this version, and there are a lot of improvements I want to make.

Things being worked on for the 1.2 release:

Features:
  Add comma seperated searching.
  Allow User to clear specific hints as complete even if the server doesn't say it is.
  Have the program remember what Season you last had selected.
  Color the Hint based on the "Classification" field of the item.
  Have Mines tab display what Elevator floor you can go to
  Have Season tabs at top say (Undiscovered) if you don't have the check yet
  Add Wind Waker Checks to display name correctly

Bugs/Fixes:
  Fix Notes clearing issue.
  Fix Freezeing up caused by updating hints via the !hint command.
  All hints go into the first tab
  Mine Elevator and chest sometimes go back
  Editing text in text_input didn't properly save
  When you connect to the server. It does not get the list of completed locations your search.
