This is a tracker specifically designed for Stardew Valley archipelago but on one specific setting.
More work has been done to make other settings possible. Other people could add checks themselves via the jsons.

Currently the tracker is implemented and server connection works. 

I have everything implemented into a pretty good state. Everything works for well.
There aren't many slowdowns or crashes. You can do a lot with the program.
The main thing I need to work on is opening it up to more settings.
