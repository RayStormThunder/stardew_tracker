This is a tracker specifically designed for Stardew Valley archipelago but on one specific setting.

Currently the tracker is implemented and sever connection works.

There are tons of bugs in this version, and there are a lot of improvements I want to make.

Things being worked on for the 1.1 release:

Features:
  Make information field editable.
  Add requirements that will make the checkbox line red if you can't get it.
  Have an overlay appear when hovering over a check giving the requirements of the check.
  Allow Wind Waker and Hollow Knight checks to be displayed.
  Have tracker automatically add checks based on what archipelago says instead of being hardcoded (This will remove the Bundles Button).
  Add new Notes tab (1 for my Checks and 1 for others).
  Add comma seperated searching.
  Better naming for hint tabs.
  When a location is hinted, add the hinted item to the checkbox line and color it purple.
  Allow User to clear specific hints as complete even if the server doesn't say it is.
  Have the program remember what Season you last had selected.
  Color the Hint based on the "Classification" field of the item.

Bugs/Fixes:
  Fix Notes clearing issue.
  Fix Hearts progressive not visually updating.
  Fix the issue of the Monster tab not being properly implemented.
  Fix Emily's Birthday.
  Remove Fish Casserole Quest from Gus' Recipes.
  Remove Rarecrow 7 and 8 from Fesitvels.
  Fix Big/Deluxe Barn/Coop descriptions.
  Move "Smashing Stone" to the Fesitvals tab as a Fair check. Make description for Fair be Fall 16 not Fall 24.
  Fix Freezeing up caused by updating hints via the !hint command.
  Change the Update All function to not delete and recreate tabs causing you to go back to the bundles tab and clearing your search.
