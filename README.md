This is a tracker specifically designed for Stardew Valley archipelago but on one specific setting.
More work has been done to make other settings possible. Other people could add checks themselves via the jsons.

Currently the tracker is implemented and sever connection works. 

There are tons of bugs in this version, and there are a lot of improvements I want to make.

Things being worked on for the 1.2 release:

Features:
  (Needed?) Add comma seperated searching.
  Allow User to clear specific hints as complete even if the server doesn't say it is.
  Have the program remember what Season you last had selected.
  Color the Hint based on the "Classification" field of the item.
  Have Mines tab display what Elevator floor you can go to.
  Have Season tabs at top say (Undiscovered) if you don't have the check yet.
  Add Wind Waker Checks to display name correctly.
  When you enter a hint in the hint field. When it moves to the top move the scroll bar to follow it.

Bugs/Fixes:
  (Can't reproduce) Fix Notes clearing issue.
  Fix Freezeing up caused by updating hints via the !hint command.
  All hints go into the first tab.
  (Might be fixed) Mine Elevator and chest sometimes go back.
  (Can't reproduce) Editing text in text_input didn't properly save.
